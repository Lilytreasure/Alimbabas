# E-Commerce -Application


An E commerce aplication built with  jetpack compose<br>
When using the https://github.com/raamcosta/compose-destinations library for Navigatons-Kotlin 1.8.0 will make  things easier for you<br>
Kotlin 1.8.0 finds the generated files automatically you do not have to add the location which can be slepless nights sometimes😂😂😂<br>

its amazing how a few lines of code manages to accomplish so much, no recycler views, forget  the adpaters, this is on a whole other level, once  you dip you toes into compose  i promise you its  hard to let go. its amazing<br>
Took me 3 days to get the application working-The day it compiled i was guaranteed of good sleep 😍😒❤ was not easy<br>
